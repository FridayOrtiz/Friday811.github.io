TL;DR: Anecdotally, the best Switch games to play if you get mildly airsick.
The winner is Diablo 3.

## The backstory

When I was younger, I used to read every day on the trip to school. I got through
countless books in rush hour traffic. The worse traffic was, the happier I'd be.
It meant more time to read my book in peace before being locked in a classroom,
sitting in the back, and continuing to read anyway while teachers got mad at 
me for ignoring their lessons. 

After learning how to drive I had to set aside books on the road. It wasn't
until years later that I realized at some point I became too nauseous to read
as a terrestrial passenger. Thankfully, I could still read books on planes.
It makes sense, flying is (generally) smoother than driving. There are no
potholes in the sky that take 15 years to fix. Unfortunately, a few years
ago, I started becoming too airsick to read. I tried gaming on a laptop
instead, but that quickly became unwieldy in a cramped economy seat. There's
rarely room for a mouse, connecting a controller leaves you with a tangled
mess of wire to deal with, and the trackpad limits you to slower games that
skew text-heavy. To make matters worse, I'm usually flying on older American
Airlines planes and their in flight entertainment options typically range
from "broken touch screen" to "overhead projector." And their stance on
in-flight power ports seems to be "better pack some spare batteries."

Last year I was looking at a week with over 36 hours of air time and decided
I could live like this no longer. No more cramped laptop games, nauseating
books, or that one season of The Big Bang Theory for the umpteenth time. I
picked up a Nintendo Switch and thought maybe this powerful yet portable
device could save me.

Now that RSA 2020 is over I think I have enough data to make some 
recommendations.

## The criteria

For a game to be viable in flight it should meet a few criteria.

 - The game should avoid text or reading as much as possible. Ideally, I can
 play with my eyes closed.
 - The game should avoid the use of motion controls or other fine grained and
 finicky controls. I'm not flying Delta, the game should be playable in light
 chop.
 - The game should be time consuming, engaging, and always keep moving. I don't
 want to beat a level, reach a good stopping point, look up, and see we're still 
 lining up for takeoff.

## The games

The following are all the games I own on my Nintendo Switch in order of
"worst to play on a plane" to "best to play on a plane."

### Super Mario Party

This game just isn't much fun without a friend, so it's pretty useless to me
when I'm flying alone. Additionally, the Switch won't let you 
disconnect the controllers in airplane mode. Even if you take it off airplane
mode, the minigames rely heavily on motion controls and the off center 
kickstand guarantees the console will flop over at the slightest nudge. Flight
attendants roll the drink cart by? Flop. Person in front of you adjusts their
seat? Flop. And just try to play a fair game of _Don't Wake Wiggler_ with
any turbulence.

Besides that, the game itself isn't too nausea inducing. If you've played
a few parties already you can pretty much ignore all the text, roll your
dice and play games. It's just not very fun solo.

### Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast

I love this game on PC. I have countless hours in it. I know all the levels
by memory, and I used to know all the secret areas too. It's one of my favorite
games of all time. So believe me when I say this port is terrible. Or at least
terrible while flying. 

There is no aim assist so the first few levels before 
you get a lightsaber are painful. I've found the motion control aiming
actually works pretty well here, with thumbsticks for gross aiming and motion
controls for fine tuning. Unfortunately waving around my Switch in flight
trying to blast Stormtroopers is guaranteed to annoy fellow travelers, so that
leaves just the thumbsticks. This is where the nausea starts to kick in. Trying
to gently nudge and precisely aim with a thumbstick and no aim assist means
focusing my eyes intensely at the screen. Intensely focusing my eyes means
nausea. Nausea means no fun for anyone. Save this one for the hotel.

### The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild

This game is fantastic but unfortunately suffers from the same aiming problems
as Jedi Outcast. Aiming isn't quite as terrible, but it's far better when you
can use motion controls. Fortunately, precise aiming isn't required to 
get through the game. Unfortunately, you still do control the camera with the
thumbstick. For some reason this still makes me slightly nauseous. Not nearly
as bad as Jedi Outcast, but enough to be unpleasant. Another major downside 
is that the game chews through battery. In handheld mode you only get about
two hours of gameplay, if that. Even with a few battery packs (I usually bring
at least two) you're still going to be running low before reaching your 
destination.

This is my go to game for playing at the terminal, but not once I'm on the
plane. The gameplay lets you find good stopping points every 20-30 minutes,
which is great when you're waiting to board. When flying, though, the
downtime between shrines and dungeons loses my attention. There's also quite
a bit of reading if you don't already have the game memorized. Great game,
just not suitable here.

### New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe

Now we're getting into "actually playable" territory. The side scrolling nature
and lack of text make it easy to play without focusing your eyes. It's easy
to just take in the whole screen and get into the zone. The gameplay is also
very forgiving is you choose an easier character. 

My only complaints are that the easy characters are too easy and the normal
characters can be a bit challenging from time to time. The slight challenge
(e.g., losing a few times to a tricky boss) and short gameplay loops mean
it's hard for this game to sustain my attention for 6+ consecutive hours.
Definitely recommend having this one in the rotation, but you're going to
want to have something else to do.

### Untitled Goose Game

For some reason infosec loves this game and I am no exception.
This game is great for playing in the air with a few caveats. The big
one is that even the most leisurely playthrough will cap out at 6 hours. 
You also can't really completely zone out while playing, you need to pay
at least a little attention to maximize the goosery.

The reliance on text is minimal, the game is impossible to lose so you
never have a chance to stop or put it down, and it's overall a very fun and 
light experience. Again, put this in the rotation but have something else to do.

### Diablo 3: Eternal Collection

By far the best mobile gaming experience I've ever had. I'd even say this is
my preferred way to play Diablo 3. This port makes the PC version look 
uninspired. 

Diablo 3 is all about establishing a rhythm for your character. I recommend
playing through a bit first until you have a few abilities unlocked and a
good groove going. Then you can board the plane and let muscle memory and the
loot treadmill teleport you to your destination. The enemy colors and
silhouettes are easy to read and react to without focusing your eyes and the
grind is very satisfying. The enemies scale to your level so the difficulty
is solely dependent on the selected difficulty level, entirely under your
control. Set the difficulty to Master if you want to be engaged or Normal if
you want to zone out and fall asleep. The game also plays pretty consistently
at 60 fps in handheld mode (with some exceptions during endgame content) and
the battery life is much better than BotW, my battery
packs easily kept it playable for the entire transcontinental journey.

Blizzard did a great job with this one. I'd put this as a "must have" for 
travel, with a few other games to taste.
