[Bad VM](https://github.com/Friday811/badvm) is a simple constrained virtual machine I made as a learning exercise. 
It is based entirely around a 2-byte word. Each operation is encoded in one 
word, each register holds one word, and the stack is a stack of words. Also it
uses both stacks and registers, which I've read is not a very practical 
approach. 

## Motivation

I wanted to learn more about how virtual machines and high level languages work
in a way that would let me play around with how it functions. I also wanted to 
provide myself with constraints to really think about how to provide high level
functionality with limited resources. Some of the features were motivated by 
curiosity, such as "how can I write an application that can completely rewrite
itself?"

The result is a very bad, very insecure, virtual machine that uses stack and 
registers and can't multiply. It is fun, though. I plan on changing it in the 
future when I have more ideas to play with.

## Design

The entire design was centered around uint16_t, or 2 byte words of data. The
first nibble is the operation, as described in the table below. The second, 
third, and fourth nibbles are used to denote registers, immediate values, 
addresses or arguments for an operation. This limitation means we can have 16 
operations (0x0 to 0xF), 16 registers (0x0 to 0xF) and 256 addresses (0x00 to 
0xFF). Thus, the maximum stack depth is 256 because it indexes from 0x00 to 
0xFF. The maximum program size is 256 instructions so that every operation is 
accessible by the CHNG operation and reachable by JMP operations.

| operation | nibble 0 | nibble 1 | nibble 2 | nibble 3 | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| NOOP | 0x0 |  |  |  | do nothing | 
| LOAD | 0x1 | reg1 | imm | imm | load imm into reg1 |
| ADD  | 0x2 | reg1 | reg2 | reg3 | reg1 = reg2 + reg3 |
| SUB  | 0x3 | reg1 | reg2 | reg3 | reg1 = reg2 - reg3 |
| CMP  | 0x4 | reg1 | reg2 | reg3 | same as SUB |
| CHNG | 0x5 | reg1 | address | address | change instruction @address to reg1 |
| PUSH | 0x6 | reg1 | | | push reg1 onto the stack |
| POP  | 0x7 | reg1 | | | pop the stack into reg1 |
| JMPL | 0x8 | reg1 | address | address | jump pc to @address if value at reg1 < 0 |
| JMPG | 0x9 | reg1 | address | address | jump pc to @address if value at reg1 > 0 |
| JMPE | 0xA | reg1 | address | address | jump pc to @address if value at reg1 == 0 |
| JMPU | 0xB |  | address | address | jump pc to @address unconditionally |
| READ | 0xC | reg1 | | | read 16 bits from FIFO into reg1 |
| PRNS | 0xD | | | 0 to print char, 1 to print int | print off the stack until a 0x0000 is reached |
| PRNT | 0xE | reg1 | | | print chars from nibble 2 and 3 of program @reg1 until a 0x0000 is reached |
| HALT | 0xF |  |  |  | exit the program |


## Assembler

The "assembler" is just a simple python script that takes hex characters from a 
text file and writes them out in binary to a new output file. The proper usage 
is:
```sh
$ python3 assemble.py inputFile outputFile
```

The script is pretty simple. Let's take a look.

```python
with open(sys.argv[1], "r") as f:
    data = "".join(line.rstrip()[0:4] for line in f)
```

This opens the input file, strips out all the whitespace, and concatenates all 
the operations together. It only takes the first 4 characters from each line, 
the rest of the characters on each line can be used as comments.

```python
    if len(data) % 4 != 0:
        print("Error: input file contains incomplete or malformed operations")
        sys.exit(1)
```

If the number of characters isn't a multiple of 4 then one of the commands is 
not properly formed and the script should exit.

```python
    print("-----   PROGRAM DUMP   -----")
    print("INS   REG1  REG2  REG3   IMM")
    print("----  ----  ----  ----  ----")
    for i in range(0, len(data), 4):
        print(f"{op_pairs[data[i]]}   r{data[i+1]}    r{data[i+2]}"
              f"    r{data[i+3]}    #{data[i+2:i+4]}")
```

The commands are interpreted and dumped to the terminal for verification by the 
user. The `op_pairs` dictionary maps the operation nibble to its name.

```python
    data = bytearray.fromhex(data)
    data[0::2], data[1::2] = data[1::2], data[0::2]  # swap word endianness
```

Finally, the result is actually assembled. The data is turned into a bytearray
from the hex string first. Then, at least on my system, the bytes in each byte 
pair need to be swapped to be properly read by the VM. The resulting file can be
given to the vm and run.

## Examples

### Assembler

You can assemble the example program by using the existing pipenv environment
and compiling the demo program as follows.

```sh
$ cd vm/asm
$ pipenv shell
$ ./assemble.py demo.vm output.vm
-----   PROGRAM DUMP   -----
INS   REG1  REG2  REG3   IMM
----  ----  ----  ----  ----
LOAD   r1    r0    rA    #0A
LOAD   r2    r0    r1    #01
LOAD   rF    r0    r0    #00
LOAD   rE    r0    r0    #00
SUB    r0    r1    r2    #12
JMPE   r0    r0    rC    #0C
SUB    r0    r0    r2    #02
ADD    rD    rE    r0    #E0
PUSH   rF    r0    r0    #00
PUSH   rD    r0    r0    #00
PRNS   r0    r0    r1    #01
JMPG   r0    r0    r6    #06
LOAD   rA    r1    r2    #12
PRNT   rA    r0    r0    #00
READ   r3    r0    r0    #00
CHNG   r3    r0    r0    #00
JMPU   r0    r0    r0    #00
HALT   r0    r0    r0    #00
NOOP   r0    r6    r8    #68
NOOP   r0    r6    r5    #65
NOOP   r0    r6    rc    #6c
NOOP   r0    r6    rc    #6c
NOOP   r0    r6    rf    #6f
NOOP   r0    r2    r0    #20
NOOP   r0    r7    r7    #77
NOOP   r0    r6    rf    #6f
NOOP   r0    r7    r2    #72
NOOP   r0    r6    rc    #6c
NOOP   r0    r6    r4    #64
NOOP   r0    r2    r1    #21
NOOP   r0    r0    r0    #00
```

### Example Program

With your program assembled, open up one terminal window and run the following 
command. The VM uses stderr for debug information so we will pipe it to 
/dev/null and get just the program output.
```sh
$ ./vm /tmp/fifo asm/output.vm 2>/dev/null
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1

hello world!
waiting to read 16 bits from FIFO /tmp/fifo...
```
Now the program is waiting to receive two hex characters into the FIFO at 
/tmp/fifo. You can echo four characters into the pipe and they will be 
interpreted as binary data by the VM and read into the program. The code is 
converting ascii characters to their equivalent bytes, do not actually pipe 
binary data into the VM. 
Open up a second terminal window and enter the following command.
```sh
$ echo FFFF > /tmp/fifo
```

In this case we're piping `FFFF` into the program
which writes `0xFFFF` as an instruction into index 0 of the program and then
unconditionally jumps to index 0. Since we told it to write `0xFFFF` the program
will halt. 
We could also write `110F` and the program will execute again instead
loading 15 into reg1, looping 15 times and printing 13 times instead of 10 and 8.
Or we could write anything we'd like and the program will be re-run with it as 
the first instruction. Writing `B00D` will cause the program to skip the loop 
and immediately jump to printing `hello world!`.
