**Qemu Link:** TODO :D

## README.md

Download the `.ova` and import the appliance into Virtualbox. Start the machine
and log in directly from the virtual console.

Username: `datascience`

Your goal is to read `/root/flag.txt` by exploiting a vulnerability in the eBPF
programs and other utilities in the `~/process-utils` folder.

Scroll down for the walkthrough (spoilers!).
