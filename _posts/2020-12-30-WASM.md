**TL;DR:** Playable game of life in this post, written in Rust, running with WebAssembly.
I started learning Rust a while ago, when I was trying to get a handle
on OS development. I followed along with 
[Philipp Oppermann's blog](https://os.phil-opp.com/) but quickly put Rust
aside for C and the [osdev wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page).

I wanted to come back to Rust and, while I was here, learn WebAssembly too.
A side project of mine recently ran up against [yul](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/languages/#yul)
which has a very wasm-like syntax (I believe it can target either eWASM or
the EVM), so two-birds-one-scone.

I did the [Rustlings course using CLion with the Rust plugin and EduTools plugin](https://blog.jetbrains.com/education/2019/12/19/rustlings-course-adaptation/)
first, then finally dove into the [rust-wasm](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/introduction.html)
tutorial. The tutorial walks you through implementing Conway's Game of Life
in Rust, building it for WebAssembly, and interacting with it through Javascript.
It was pretty fun, I highly recommend giving it a try.

Anyway, here's the interactive Game of Life. I ended up using `FixedBitSet`
for the cells, from one of the optional tutorial exercises. The slider controls
the game speed and you can click any cell to toggle it. Press Play (▶) to start!

.slider {
    width: 270px;
    display: block;
