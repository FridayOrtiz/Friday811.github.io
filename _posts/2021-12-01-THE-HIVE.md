**TL;DR:** A (relatively) simple eBPF capture the flag challenge and writeup. The
challenge was made by a colleague on the R&D team and the writeup by one of our
detection engineers. The writeup goes through the whole discovery process and is
a great way to dive into BPF.

## Welcome to the Hive

A few weeks ago the R&D team at Red Canary created an internal CTF for anyone
interested to participate in. The Hive ([download here](/download/thehive)) is a
challenge created by one of our staff engineers, Dave, who as far as I can tell
does not want to be found on the Internet. The goal of the challenge was to
introduce participants to the workings of BPF, in the hopes that the
discovery/trial-and-error process of solving the challenge would give them a
solid foundation in the technology. It turned out more successful than we hoped!

If you'd like to give the challenge a go, click that download link above and try
to find the flag. You'll need a relatively up to date Linux machine (we used
Ubuntu 20.04, but it should work on a bunch of distros) with root credentials. 

With that out of the way, below is a writeup by Del, one of our detection
engineers.  He did a great job documenting his path from knowing nothing about
BPF to knowing something about BPF. If you get stuck, you can follow along
below. Spoilers from here on out!

### _Reverse Engineering `thehive` didn't work out for me._

Using Ghidra to disassemble and decompile `thehive` was frustrating.  It seems
that Rust, which is what `thehive` was written in, does not produce code that
Ghidra deals well with.  This was further complicated by the fact the `thehive`
uses the [Oxidebpf library](https://github.com/redcanaryco/oxidebpf), which
added another layer that needed to be understood.  I had similar experiences
trying to use edb to debug the program while running. The only useful
information I extracted was to determine that the `thehive` doesn't seem to pay
attention, to or collect, user input.

In retrospect, when you think about the nature of BPF, it makes sense that
Ghidra and edb would only have visibility into the 'loader' program, and the
guts of this challenge likely reside in the BPF program that it loads into the
kernel.

### _Reverse Engineering the BPF program didn't work out for me._

BPF programs run in a virtual machine hosted in the Linux kernel.  They are
loaded by a regular program which uses system calls that will verify and load
the BPF program.  BPF programs can read and write in memory data structures
called 'maps'. These 'maps' are the primary mechanism for a BPF program to
communicate results to user space.

Although there are other interesting tools, it seems that two tools are most
often mentioned as useful for investigating BPF programs: bpftool and bpftrace.
The version of the kernel running has an impact on what information is available
to these tools.  BPF is an evolving capability and new capabilities are being
added on a regular basis.

Roughly speaking, bpftool is a great tool for collecting data about, and
manipulating, BPF programs after they've been loaded into the kernel.  The
bpftrace tool is great for loading and running BPF programs in a simple way from
the command line (e.g. running one-line BPF programs).

Using bpftool, I was able to discover the BPF program that was being loaded by
`thehive`.

Running the command `sudo bpftool prog list` listed info about all the loaded
BPF programs, including:

```
57: kprobe  tag a01e72fbd4579d51  gpl
	loaded_at 2021-11-26T18:23:56-0700  uid 0
	xlated 368B  jited 203B  memlock 4096B  map_ids 1
	pids thehive(2714)
```

One of the other capabilities of bpftool is to list a BPF program in the native
instruction set used by the BPF virtual-machine. Using this capability, once I
discovered the BPF program loaded by `thehive`, I was able to examine the code it
compiled to.

```
$ sudo bpftool prog dump xlated id 57
   0: (85) call bpf_get_current_pid_tgid#135712
   1: (63) *(u32 *)(r10 -4) = r0
   2: (18) r1 = 0x5b5548405d585451
   4: (7b) *(u64 *)(r10 -80) = r1
   5: (b7) r1 = 0
   6: (7b) *(u64 *)(r10 -24) = r1
   7: (7b) *(u64 *)(r10 -32) = r1
   8: (7b) *(u64 *)(r10 -40) = r1
   9: (b7) r1 = 42
  10: (7b) *(u64 *)(r10 -48) = r1
  11: (18) r1 = 0x313b3d3736242010
  13: (7b) *(u64 *)(r10 -56) = r1
  14: (18) r1 = 0x2b25381424201734
  16: (7b) *(u64 *)(r10 -64) = r1
  17: (18) r1 = 0x2f1a222c2d333060
  19: (7b) *(u64 *)(r10 -72) = r1
  20: (b7) r1 = 102
  21: (73) *(u8 *)(r10 -80) = r1
  22: (b7) r1 = 1
  23: (b7) r2 = 1
  24: (bf) r3 = r10
  25: (07) r3 += -80
  26: (0f) r3 += r2
  27: (71) r4 = *(u8 *)(r3 +0)
  28: (bf) r5 = r1
  29: (07) r5 += 55
  30: (af) r4 ^= r5
  31: (73) *(u8 *)(r3 +0) = r4
  32: (07) r1 += 1
  33: (07) r2 += 1
  34: (15) if r2 == 0x40 goto pc+1
  35: (05) goto pc-12
  36: (bf) r2 = r10
  37: (07) r2 += -4
  38: (bf) r3 = r10
  39: (07) r3 += -80
  40: (18) r1 = map[id:1]
  42: (b7) r4 = 0
  43: (85) call htab_map_update_elem#160336
  44: (b7) r0 = 0
  45: (95) exit
```

I'll spare you the details, but I spent a lot of time trying to reverse engineer
this program.  Basically: lines 0 - 23 load seemingly gibberish values into
memory, lines 24 - 34 loop through those values in memory,  XOR'ng each value
with a different value. Finally, the rest of the program appears to load the
resulting values into a map.  It seems clear that the loop XOR'ng the values is
decoding them, with the result then being loaded into a map.

Sadly, I was unable to decode the strings using this code.  I'm sure it's
possible, but my binary foo wasn't up to the job.  Once I started asking myself
if endianness mattered, and did I really understand how bytes were being stored
by the vm, I threw up my hands and decided there had to be an easier way.

I did however, come to understand what this program does, and that it writes a
value to a map.  This value is almost certainly the flag!

### _Letting the BPF program do all the work did work out (eventually)_

One of the capabilities of bpftool is the ability to dump the contents of a map.
Unfortunately, when I ran `thehive`, although it loaded the BPF program into the
kernel, it appears that the BPF program never runs.  I say this because the
associated map never collects a value:

```
$ sudo bpftool map dump id 1
Found 0 elements
```

Looking at the data from `bpftool prog list` for the BPF program, we know that the
BPF program is attached to a specific kernel function via the kprobe capability
in BPF.  This means that when that particular kernel function executes, the BPF
program attached to it will also be executed.  So, it appears that when the
correct kernel function gets invoked, this BPF program will run (and write the
flag to the map associated with it).

So which system function is this BPF program attached to?  There are literally
thousands of possibilities:

```
$ sudo bpftrace -l | grep kprobe: | wc
  51256   51256 1416114
```

(BTW, one of the complications with kprobes is that the set of kernel functions
which are available, varies with the kernel. Since at this point I expected the
BPF program to be attached to something that is often used (such as execve), I
started to worry that maybe I was running a kernel that didn't support the
kprobe that thehive tried to attach the BPF program to.  This led to building
several VMs, each running the most current version of the kernel I could find.
All to no avail.)

Luckily, I eventually discovered that one of the other capabilities of bpftool
is to list any installed kprobes.

```
$ sudo bpftool perf list
pid 2714  fd 6: prog_id 57  kprobe  func do_mount  offset 0
```

Eureka!  This reveals that the BPF has been assigned to the `do_mount` kernel
function.  So, if I can arrange for that kernel function to be invoked, the BPF
program should execute and write the flag to the map.  Even better, this
function sounds like it must be available everywhere.

Well, much hilarity ensued as I tried every way I could think of to use the
mount command to invoke the `do_mount` system call.  The bottom line is that I
mounted ISO's, devices, anything I could think of, all to no effect.

As a sanity check, I ran the following bpftrace program to monitor for `do_mount`
invocations:

```
$ sudo bpftrace -e 'kprobe:do_mount { printf("mount by %d\n", tid); }'
```

which confirmed that I was not successfully triggering the `do_mount` kernel
function.

Searching the list of kprobes (`bpftrace -l`) shows that `do_mount` is a legitimate
kprobe target, but I just wasn't able to trigger it on several different kernels
that I tried.  Researching `do_mount` didn't provide a definitive answer, although
there was some suggestion that it's only used during boot.

```
Author's note: what follows should not be necessary to get the solution. In our
own testing we were successful with running the standard mount command. The
command doesn't even need to succeed, so long as do_mount is invoked at some
point. But, honestly, Del's solution here is pretty darn clever.
```

### _So here I resorted to using a blunt instrument_

Finally, in desperation, I decided to try patching the program to change which
system function this BPF program was being associated with.  A quick search
using the strings program against the binary suggested that the name of the
function was in fact being used to load the BPF program.

Using the ghex binary file editor I manually changed the instances of `do_mount`
to `execve`, since I knew that the `execve` kernel function was being invoked often.
I null terminated this string, since the `do_mount` strings appeared to be null
terminated (in Rust, strings aren't necessarily null terminated).  However the
patched binary panicked when I tried it.

On the theory that the strings were not null terminated, I searched the list of
kprobe names for one the same length as `do_mount`, and decided to try replacing
`do_mount` with `do_rmdir`.

With this change, the patched binary ran successfully.  After starting my hacked
verson of thehive as root, I executed the commands:

```
$ mkdir test
$ rmdir test
$ sudo bpftool prog list (to obtain the id of the map)
$ sudo bpftool map dump id 7
key:
ad 1a 00 00
value:
66 6c 61 67 7b 74 68 65  5f 70 72 6f 6f 66 5f 69
73 5f 69 6e 5f 74 68 65  5f 70 75 64 64 69 6e 67
7d 58 59 5a 5b 5c 5d 5e  5f 60 61 62 63 64 65 66
67 68 69 6a 6b 6c 6d 6e  6f 70 71 72 73 74 75 76
Found 1 element
```

Copying the hex strings above into CyberChef, and then running the 'From Hex'
recipe with 'Delimiter' set to Auto, revealed the flag!

For me, this was a deep immersion in the modern BPF, something I had only
fleetingly played with before.  Overall it was a complete blast, and I'm
grateful for the opportunity to play with it.  I'd certainly appreciate any
corrections or suggestions on better ways to approach this challenge.
