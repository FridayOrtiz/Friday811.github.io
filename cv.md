#### Top Languages

Here are the top five languages I use by hours, as recorded by 
[ActivityWatch](https://activitywatch.net/) on a monthly basis.

| Month | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|
| April 2021 | Rust | Python | C | Shell Script | JavaScript |
| March 2021 | Rust | JavaScript | Java | Go | Python |
| February 2021 | Python | Rust | Shell Script | Java | JavaScript |
| January 2021 | Go | Java | TypeScript | Python | Shell Script |
| December 2020 | Rust | Go | Python | JavaScript | Java |
| November 2020 | Java | Go | TypeScript | C | Python |
| October 2020 | Java | TypeScript | Shell Script | Go | Python |

My new employer is less than thrilled to allow ActivityWatch on corporate
machines, so the information stops at April. I do have some GitHub stats,
but keep in mind these only use publicly available information.
